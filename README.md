Photon-Mint-2.96
================

A new version of Photon Mint with many bugfixes. We are fast approaching the public release of Glass Mint, or Mint 3.0. Mint 3 will differ from Mint 2 as much as Python 3 currently differs from Python 2. This is also the first highly usable and/or practical version of Mint that will be licensed under the GPLv3, to encourage sharing and freedom of code for all.
