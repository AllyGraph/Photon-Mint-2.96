Because Mint itself is a functional and an object-oriented language,
some of the code for the Mint Interpreter and Virtual Machine is written
in an object-oriented style (see Interpreter.java), and other parts, such
as FileIO.java and any given subclass of BuiltinSub, will be written
in a functional or lambda-based style.
